  <h3 align="center">Fashion sustainability research, but make it shopping.</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Finding clothing and accessories that fit your body, style, budget is hard enough.  If you have sustainability standards for your fashion purchases, it can feel impossible to find products that check all the boxes.  That’s why I built Veronaut.  Veronaut presents product information alongside sustainability ratings so you can make an informed decision while shopping online - without the hours of research.
