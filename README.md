## Product research, but make it shopping
Finding the right clothes to fit your style, budget, and body can be tricky.  Add in your ethical-production standards and it can be downright frustrating to find products that check all the boxes.  

Thatâ€™s why I built Veronaut.  Veronaut presents product information in a way that feels like online shopping.  Understanding the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of your purchases will help you support brands that you believe in.',
