        Good design
      </h3>
      <p>
        We value versatile styles that bring out our best selves in the office and at happy hour.  That hold up on our bike commutes and school pick-ups.  Our ideal clothing is bra-friendly, easy care, and has pockets.

        Ethical
      </h3>
      <p>
        We report which brands have the most transparent supply chains, and which brands prioritize worker safety, living wages, and freedom of association (the right to join a union).

      <h3>
        Sustainable
      </h3>
      <p>
        We feature clothing made with natural and cellulose-based fibers, with exceptions for a few categories like outerwear and swimwear.  While we include thoughtfully-sourced wool products, we exclude leather and fur.
