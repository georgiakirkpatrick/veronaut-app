  <!-- <h3 align="center">Fashion sustainability research, but make it shopping.</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Finding clothing and accessories that fit your body, style, budget is hard enough.  If you have sustainability standards for your fashion purchases, it can feel impossible to find products that check all the boxes.  That’s why I built Veronaut.  Veronaut presents product information alongside sustainability ratings so you can make an informed decision while shopping online - without the hours of research.

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

<!-- Veronaut was created in 2020 as the capstone project for my Bloc (now Thinkful) Full-Stack Engineering bootcamp.  The requirements for my capstone project were to create a responsive, full-stack app using React.js, CSS, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.  This was a solo project which I completed with occasional help from a mentor.

The early vision of this app resulted from my professional background. Before I joined a software engineering bootcamp, I earned a biology degree with a focus on environmental conservation and additional studies in economics, conducted research of [smallholder](#smallholder) cotton farms in Peru, and founded a mission-based clothing brand, [Silvania](https://silvaniaperu.com).  My background in the fashion industry, as well as my personal experience shopping for clothes, has led me to see that finding sustainably-made clothing as a consumer is unnecessarily cumbersome. -->
